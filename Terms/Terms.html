  <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
  <p class="update-date">Last Updated: September 19, 2018</p>

  <section>
    <h2>I. Introduction</h2>
    <p>These Terms of Use (“Terms”) apply only to the websites, including <a href="https://www.esring.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.esring.com</a>, and services controlled by E &amp; S Ring Management Corp. (“E &amp; S,” “we,” “us” or “our”) where these Terms are posted (collectively, the “Sites”). Use of our Sites constitutes acceptance of these Terms.</p>
    <p>Please note the arbitration provision set forth below, which may require you to arbitrate any claims you may have against E &amp; S on an individual basis. <strong>Arbitration on an individual basis means that you will not have, and you waive, the right for a judge or jury to decide your claims, and that you may not proceed in a class, consolidated or representative capacity.</strong></p>
    <p>These Terms establish a legally binding agreement between you and E &amp; S. We strongly encourage you to review them carefully, along with our Privacy Policy, before accessing or using any part of our Sites or services.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>II. Account Creation and Passwords</h2>
    <p>To access certain portions of the Sites, you must create an account. You agree to provide truthful and accurate information during the account creation process. You also agree to maintain the accuracy of any submitted data. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, or incomplete, E &amp; S reserves the right to terminate your account and suspend your use of any and all services offered through the Sites.</p>
    <p>You are responsible for preserving the confidentiality of your account password and will notify us of any known or suspected unauthorized use of your account. You agree that you are responsible for all acts or omissions that occur on your account while your password is being used.</p>
    <p>We may implement security measures to help protect your account, but we cannot guarantee the absolute security of any information you transmit or store online. You acknowledge and accept this risk when creating an account.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>III. Age Limitation</h2>
    <p>The Sites are not intended for use by persons under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect information from visitors under the age of 18, and in the event that we learn that a person under the age of 18 has provided us with personal information, we will delete such personal information.</p>
    <p>By using the Sites, you represent that you are at least 18 years of age or accessing the Sites under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to be bound by these Terms on your behalf.</p>

  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>VI. No Framing</h2>
