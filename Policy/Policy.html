      <p>Our Sites use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. ("Google").

    <p>Our Sites may contain links to third-party websites. When you visit a website for a specific property, that website may be controlled by a third party. When you pay rent, you may do so through a website controlled by a third party. When you click on a job opening or other external link, you may be directed to a third party website.

    <p>The Sites also offer you the ability to interact with plug-ins from social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, Google+, and LinkedIn. The Oasis may know that you clicked on a social plug-in or receive other information from these social media sites. Similarly, if you have previously provided Personal Information to a third party operating a plug-in on the Sites, then this third-party may recognize you on the Sites. Your use of social network plug-ins is subject to each social media site’s privacy policy and other terms and conditions, which may differ from ours, so please read those policies carefully to understand their practices and your options. As with linked sites, The Oasis has no control over the information that is collected, stored, or used by social network plug-ins.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>IX. NOTICE REGARDING PUBLIC POSTING AREAS</h2>
    <p>Please note that any information you include in a message you post to any chat room, forum or other public posting area is available to anyone with Internet access. If you do not want people to know your email address, for example, do not include it in any message you post publicly. PLEASE BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL WHEN DISCLOSING ANY INFORMATION IN CHAT ROOMS, FORUMS AND OTHER PUBLIC POSTING AREAS. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE USE BY OTHERS OF THE INFORMATION THAT YOU DISCLOSE IN CHAT ROOMS, FORUMS AND OTHER PUBLIC POSTING AREAS.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>X. SECURITY</h2>
    <p>No data transmissions over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you understand that any information you transfer to The Oasis is done at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make reasonable efforts to ensure security on our systems. If we learn of a security systems breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. By using the Sites or providing Personal Information to us, you agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy and administrative issues relating to your use of the Sites. We may post a notice on our Sites if a security breach occurs. We may also send an email to you at the email address you have provided to us in these circumstances. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.</p>

    <p>We recommend that you take additional measures to protect yourself, including installing antivirus software, closing browsers after use, keeping your passwords confidential, and making sure that you regularly update software and apps. If you have reason to believe that the Personal Information that we have collected or our system security has been breached, please promptly notify us using the contact information provided in the Contact section at the end of this Privacy Policy.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>XI. ASSIGNMENT</h2>
    <p>In the event that all or part of our assets are sold or acquired by another party, or in the event of a merger, you grant us the right to assign the Personal and Non-Personal Information collected about you via the Sites.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>XII. DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE</h2>
    <p>Except where and to the extent prohibited by law, by using the Sites, you and The Oasis agree that, if there is any controversy, claim, action, or dispute arising out of or related to your use of the Sites, or the breach, enforcement, interpretation, or validity of this Privacy Policy or any part of it (“Dispute”), both parties shall first try in good faith to settle such Dispute by providing written notice to the other party describing the facts and circumstances of the Dispute and allowing the receiving party thirty (30) days in which to respond to or settle the Dispute. Notice shall be sent to:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Us, at The Oasis, 6300 Green Valley Circle, Culver City, CA 90230; or</li>
      <li>You, at the address we have on file for you.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Both you and The Oasis agree that this dispute resolution procedure is a condition precedent that must be satisfied before initiating any litigation or filing any claim against the other party. IF ANY DISPUTE CANNOT BE RESOLVED BY THE ABOVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURE, YOU AGREE THAT THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION FOR SUCH DISPUTE WILL BE DECIDED BY BINDING ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS MEANS THAT YOU WILL NOT HAVE, AND YOU WAIVE, THE RIGHT FOR A JUDGE OR JURY TO DECIDE YOUR CLAIMS, AND THAT YOU MAY NOT PROCEED IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY.</p>

    <p>Other rights that you and we would otherwise have in court will not be available or will be more limited in arbitration, including discovery and appeal rights. All such disputes shall be exclusively submitted to JAMS (or another mutually agreed arbitration provider) for binding arbitration under its rules then in effect, before one arbitrator to be mutually agreed upon by both parties.</p>

    <p>The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute arising under or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Privacy Policy, including any claim that all or any part of this Privacy Policy is void or voidable.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>XIII. CHOICE OF LAW</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy has been made in, and shall be construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to any conflict of law principles. The parties acknowledge that this Privacy Policy evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the provision in the preceding paragraph with respect to applicable substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of this Privacy Policy shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16).</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>XIV. YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</h2>

    <p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits visitors to the Sites who are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of Personal Information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. However, we do not share your data with third parties for their direct marketing at this time.</p>

    <h3>Right to Know</h3>
    <p>You have the right to know and request information about the categories and specific pieces of Personal Information we have collected about you, as well as the categories of sources from which such information is collected, the purpose for collecting such information, and the categories of third parties with whom we share such information.

    <h3>Right to Opt-Out of Sale</h3>

    <h3>Right to Non-Discrimination</h3>

If you would like to exercise one or more of the rights above, please contact us using the contact information provided below. You may designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. Such authorized agent must be registered with the California Secretary of State. We may deny a request from an agent that does not submit proof that they have been authorized by you to act on your behalf.</p>

    <p>We may need to confirm your verifiable consumer request before completing your request, and, for example, may ask for you to confirm data points we already have about you or that you log into your account that you have with us. We will only use Personal Information provided in a consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>XV. HOW WE RESPOND TO DO NOT TRACK SIGNALS</h2>
    <p>At this time our Sites do not recognize automated browser signals regarding tracking mechanisms, including “Do Not Track” instructions.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>XVI. INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS</h2>
    <p>We are based in the United States.
